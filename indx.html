      <h1><b><i><u>Roblox Company Information</u></i></b></h1>
      <br/>
    Roblox was founded in 2004. The founders were David Baszucki and Erik Cassel. The main
    <br/>
    headquarters are located in San Mateo, California.
    <br/>
    The first couple hundred builders of Roblox were all developers, investors, testers, and
    <br/>
    friends of the founders. It's hard to say who the first player of Roblox was since some of those
    <br/>
    early accounts are still active.
    <br/>
    Our project straddles several rapidly-developing aspects of internet entertainment: virtual
    <br/>
    worlds, casual gaming, and player-constructed content. Roblox is free to play and safe for
    <br/>
    kids aged 4+. Our product remains under development and changes to the apps and product
    <br/>
    happen frequently. We deeply value community feedback as we continue to make Roblox
    <br/>
    into a platform that will excite the imagination of the young and the young at heart. We
    <br/>
    encourage you to provide your ideas, suggestions, and feedback by using this form. 
    <br/>
    We know that many players and creators are excited about the idea of visiting the Roblox
    <br/>
    offices. You can read more about this by visiting our Corporate Site and scrolling down to sign
    <br/>
    up for Roblox HQ tours.
